# Rock, paper, scissors with a twist
My first usage of Vanilla Javascript to build a simple game. Known for everyone, rock, paper, scissord in easy mode and also I've attached a hard mode
inspired by the show The Big Bang Theory - added two new choices (Lizard and Spock) - version made by Sheldon Cooper.

Project inspired by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Javascript Foundations course.
